# Fictrac-Setup

1. Follow everything at https://github.com/rjdmoore/fictrac till cloning the vcpkg directory. Clone the vcpkg directory in this repository and 
not the one that is at https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg which is pointed by the fictrac page. 

2. If you have issues finding the build tools for Visual Studio, just go to https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202017&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads
and download Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.9). 
  - I hope you would not have to do this till the computers don't break down completely. If you do have to do it, download it, click on 
  "C++" related checkbopx on the top left and install. It should be fairly straight forward. Contact Suyash if you get stuck anywhere. 
  
3. Now, once you have downloaded the vcpkg directory from this repository, follow the guide at https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg to 
hook up user wide integration

4. Now, get back to the fictrac github page, and follow 1(iv) and 2 steps. DO NOT DO step 3 now. 

5. There is a Trackball.cpp file you will have to download from this repo and replace it as fictrac/src - this modifies the output that fictrac
gives to oue requirements. 

6. Once you have done that, go ahead and do step 3 - 5. You should be good to go now. 

In case of any issue, contact Suyash! 

Ways of contactine me might change but ask Ed and contact Suyash.
